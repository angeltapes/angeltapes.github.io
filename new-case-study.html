            <h2>Case study: interaction design for HMRC</h2>
            <p>
              I worked with stakeholders, researchers and developers to redesign
              one of the most complex online services in the UK.
            </p>
            <h2>The brief</h2>
            <p>
              HMRC's online service for Income Tax contains dozens of online
              journeys, including self-employment, capital gains and pensions.
              It contains hundreds of screens. Income tax 'policy' is held in
              documents, on gov.uk and on complicated online manuals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our team was made up of a business analyst, user researcher and
              content designer. We were in daily contact with subject matter
              experts from HMRC to help us develop the service.
            </p>
            <p>
              The stakeholders had had a combative relationship with UCD
              colleagues in the past. I felt it was important to meet them
              halfway.
            </p>
            <h2>What I did</h2>
            <h3>Built bridges with stakeholders</h3>
            <p>
              Stakeholders and ‘policy’ colleagues define what the team should
              build. They also help content designers come up with question
              wordings. I mapped out user flows with stakeholders to check their
              understanding then turned these into prototypes.
            </p>
            <p>
              We tried to include stakeholders in User Research so that they
              could see the impact of our content and designs on service users.
              Our User Researcher would also run wash-up sessions at the end of
              each round of User Research to check their understanding.
            </p>
            <h3>Built a complex prototype based on the gov.uk design system</h3>
            <p>
              I used the GDS version of every pattern and component as a default
              then developed variations on these when the research told us we
              needed a different solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              The existing service relied heavily on paper worksheets for
              accountants to calculate tax returns. I built calculations into
              the prototype to automate this process for the user.
            </p>
            <h3>Passed the design over to developers</h3>
            <p>
              With the business analyst, I took time to pass the design over to
              the developent team to build. We held a kick-off meeting to take
              them through the journey. I also mapped out user flows to explain
              sub-journeys.
            </p>
            <p>
              I created a 'current' area of the prototype for developers to
              refer to. I kept this separate from the journeys we were currently
              testing. Finally, I coached content designers on how to hand over
              error messages, hidden text and URLs.
            </p>
            <h2>The outcome</h2>
            <p>
              By the time I left in July 2024 I was the longest-sering designer
              on the project. Our user research showed the changes made a
              positive impact on taxpayers and accountants.
