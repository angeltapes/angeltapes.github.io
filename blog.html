    <h1>New design tools for content designers</h1>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m writing this at the beginning of 2025. AI tools like chatGPT are
      disrupting the tech industry. At the same time, content designers still
      need tools to create design and copy, without using an AI assistant. This
      article will give you quick tour of some useful tools for content
      creation.
    </p>
    <h2>Writing tools</h2>
    <p>
      I asked content designer
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-r-cohen/">Emma Cohen</a> what
      tools she uses day to day. Her copy has to be pitched at the right level
      for her audience.
    </p>
    <p>Here's her response, in full:</p>
    <p>
      My immediate response was that I don't use many tools - I use my good ol'
      brain and eye for detail mostly. But I do use some tools, depending on the
      situation.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        WebFX - in my current role, I use the WebFX readability tool quite a
        bit:
        <a href="https://www.webfx.com/tools/read-able/"
          >https://www.webfx.com/tools/read-able/</a
        >
        - Our team is rewriting a lot of complex content at scale and we have a
        goal of hitting a Flesch-Kincaid score of at least 70. I use the tool as
        a final check at the end of creating my content piece to check the
        readability level.
      </li>
      <li>
        Like a lot of Content Designers I'm sure, I sometimes use the Hemingway
        editor app to highlight complex sentences and the passive voice -
        <a href="https://hemingwayapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
          >https://hemingwayapp.com/</a
        >. I'll often use Hemingway if I'm struggling with the readability level
        of an article.
      </li>
      <li>
        I've also recently discovered this tool -
        <a href="https://goblin.tools/Formalizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
          >https://goblin.tools/Formalizer</a
        >. You can add your text and ask for it to be made more accessible or
        informal. It's fun to use. (Not related to content design, but I've
        discovered there's a 'Chef' option in Goblin Tools where you can add
        random ingredients in your fridge and it comes up with recipe ideas...
        how cool is that?!)
      </li>
      <li>
        Not sure if this is classed as a tool, but I use Google Trends quite a
        bit if I'm researching language that users use (especially if I don't
        have access to any user research) -
        <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/"
          >https://trends.google.com/trends/</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        Also, this is more of a resource than a tool, but I spend a lot of time
        looking at the GDS style guide -
        <a
          href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          >https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z</a
        >. It's my go-to style guide, especially if the organisation I'm working
        with doesn't have fully developed style guidance (which has happened
        with my current project). (Another style guide I refer to often is the
        Readability Guidelines
        <a href="https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/"
          >https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/</a
        ><a
          href="https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/)"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          >)</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Lastly, and again this is more of a resource than a tool, but I often
        use the Plain English campaign's A to Z of alternative words -
        <a
          href="https://www.plainenglish.co.uk/the-a-z-of-alternative-words.html"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          >https://www.plainenglish.co.uk/the-a-z-of-alternative-words.html</a
        >
        - to help me find less complex words to use.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Traditional document editors: Word, Google Docs</h2>
    <p>
      The web is an interactive medium but it contains static documents.
      Traditional writing and publishing still exists on the web because older
      technologies never quite die out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Content designers may still use established tools like MS Office, Google
      documents or Confluence to write copy. A large part of content design is
      about collaboration: they find the right people in an organisation to
      write and review web content. There's often a 'review cycle' or sign-off
      process to make sure the copy is legal and compliant.
    </p>
    <p>
      For documents like a Terms and conditions page or a help article Word and
      Google docs tools are likely to do the job. Allowing people on the project
      to comment and make suggestions on the copy is also useful on a lot of
      projects.
    </p>
    <h2>'No code' solutions</h2>
    <p>
      I've seen at least one designer advertise their approach as 'no code'.
      Design platforms like Canva and Figma let people develop layouts and write
      content without using any HTML or CSS, the languages of the web. Webflow
      goes slightly further and lets you develop and host interactive web
      services with no code.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the project is using a CMS like Wordpress or Umbraco, or a web hosting
      solution like Wix or Shopify, designers can also use WYSIWYG interfaces to
      work on each page and add graphics and interactivity, without having to
      code.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lot of the design industry is aimed at marketing and eCommerce. If
      you're primarily developing services which people can access through
      Google and which involve browsing and buying, you're likely to use a
      no-code solution.
    </p>
    <h2>Designing with code</h2>
    <p>
      The part of the tech industry where I've carved out my career isn't
      generally about pubic-facing websites or eCommerce. Instead, I've made a
      living from designing software and complex interactions like password
      management and forms. I've spent a lot of time in the public sector where
      the average interaction is between a citizen and the government. In this
      domain, I've learned to use code-based tools to design tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's why: if you're writing content for interactive screens, you're no
      longer working on a 'document' in the traditional sense. You're creating a
      way to interact with a system. The interaction has to be easy to learn.
      You have to be able to offer a similar experience on laptops and
      smartphones. You have to cater for users who use a screen reader or who
      adjust the size of text on their device.
    </p>
    <p>
      People who work in software, in apps and in online services therefore need
      to understand accessibility. Good content designers need a working
      knowledge of how to write HTML so that they can use the right conventions
      when they're writing content. They need to be close to the code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take the case of radio buttons. A set of radio buttons needs a legend at
      the top (usually a question) then a label for each button. It's not that
      easy to convey this on a Word document. It's easier to create the
      component on a real HTML page.
    </p>
    <fieldset>
      <legend>Who is the chosen one?</legend>
      <label for="frodo">Frodo Baggins</label>
      <input id="frodo" name="frodo" type="radio" value="frodo" />
      <label for="paul">Paul Atreides</label>
      <input id="paul" name="paul" type="radio" value="paul" />
      <label for="harry">Harry Potter</label>
      <input id="harry" name="harry" type="radio" value="harry" />
    </fieldset>
    <p>
      We rely on conventions to design online forms. Over the years the tech
      community has evolved ways of offering these components. For reference,
      try the
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_type_radio.asp"
        >W3C schools website</a
      >
      or
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/radio/"
        >World Wide web consortium</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2>The HTML5 Editor and Codepen</h2>
    <p>
      It's possible to write your content in Word then hand it to an interaction
      designer or developer to turn into screens. However, I'd suggest you'll
      want to view your content on an actual screen to be able to tweak the
      words and get the tone of voice you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      I often use the <a href="https://html5-editor.net/">HTML5 editor</a> to
      create and edit components. You can also use it if you're copying and
      pasting text from Word or Google docs. The most useful function is often
      the 'clear formatting' option which removes any unnecessary code.
    </p>
    <p>
      The HTML5 editor doesn't allow you to save your content. To do this you
      can use a website like
      <a href="https://codepen.io/">https://codepen.io/</a> if you're working on
      self-contained pages.
    </p>
    <h2>Serious code editors: Atom, VS Code, Sublime</h2>
    <p>
      If you need to be close to the code for the project you're working on, you
      may want to install one of the code editors used by developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It takes a bit of time to get used to this kind of software. If you're
      working with a designer or a developer with good code skills they'll help
      you get up to speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the big advantages you get from working this way is that you get
      access to add-ons which can help with your workflow. The 'Go live'
      function in VS code gives you a server to run a website locally on your
      machine. You can then view your web pages in your browser as you work.
    </p>
    <h2>Government design in the UK</h2>
    <p>
      The public sector in the UK has offered a
      <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/" target="_blank"
        >common design system</a
      >
      for the past decade. It's also created a prototyping kit for designers to
      build and host their own demo versions of online services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advantage of this is that designers are working with real HTML to
      create their web pages. If they work solely in Word and Google docs
      they're likely to have the wrong mindset. A Word document isn't a web
      page. Making prototypes in code you're working closely to the medium of
      the web.
    </p>
    <h2>Glitch websites for rapid content iterations</h2>
    <p>
      One of my favourite online services is provided by
      <a href="https://bobbyking.glitch.me/blog.html">Glitch</a>. They offer the
      ability to create free web projects with a Glitch domain. If you can use
      CSS then you can create realistic versions of web pages - see my
      <a href="https://bobbyking.glitch.me/govuk.html"
        >Government data dashboard</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2>Now prototype it</h2>
    <p>
      This start-up provides a way for content editors to create and edit pages
      without the need for an external editor:
      <a href="https://nowprototype.it/">Now prototype it</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some designers this could be a useful solution as they can create
      prototypes and host them in the cloud. You can then share them with
      colleagues or run user research to test out your new website or service.
    </p>
    <h2>The future: designing with data</h2>
    <p>
      This topic deserves a whole blog post in itself, but briefly: anyone who
      uses an online service leaves a trail of data behind. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        analytics data - what pages they visited and what parts of the service
        they used
      </li>
      <li>user generated content - for example, messages and uploads</li>
      <li>personal data - including their age, location and device</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With data mining and machine learning, online services have more
      information than ever on the people who use a service. They can use this
      to improve the online service as well as offering analytical tools to
      their customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For content designers, understanding data is likely to be a useful skill
      in the future. Established industry tools include Tableau and Power Bi for
      data visualisation. You can also experiment with a free account at
      <a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable HQ</a> to try out their
      tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my experience, these systems aren't easy to learn as they need you to
      have a working knowledge of statistics and well as learning some fairly
      demanding code. On the other hand, understanding this field might help you
      land a role where you work with data scientists and developers. The higher
      bar for entry into the data field means that the jobs are likely to be
      more secure and better-paid over time.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This has been a quick tour of the tools available to content designers. As
      Machine Learning changes the way we interact with computers it's likely
      these tools will evolve. At the same time, conventions like HTML and CSS
      are likely to remain the common language of the web. Content designers who
      understand code will able to to create accessible designs using
      conventions built up over the decades. That's likely to remain an
      advantage in a competitive jobs market.
