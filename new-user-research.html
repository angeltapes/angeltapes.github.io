            <h2>Case study: user research at the Scottish Government</h2>
            <p>
              Between 2018 and 2024 I ran Discovery projects for ILF Scotland,
              Social Security Scotland, the Scottish National Investment Bank,
              NatureScot and the Scottish Treasury.
            </p>
            <h2>The brief</h2>
            <p>
              Government bodies hire me to research a new service or to help
              them transform an existing one. I run research with service users
              and internal staff. I'll usually produce a service map and a set
              of quotes arranged by theme.
            </p>
            <p>The challenges I usually have are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Teaching people about user-centred design and helping them get
              over their initial discomfort
              </li>
              <li>
              Working with complicated legislation that can be difficult to
              implement</li>
            
            <li>Running ethical research within time and budget constraings</li>
               </ul>
            <h2>What I did</h2>
            <h3>Capture research questions and a write a problem statement</h3>
            <p>
              I spend the first few weeks of every project getting to know
              people and finding if the organisation has any existing research.
            </p>
            <p>
              After I've met as many people as possible I run a kick off meeting
              and propose a research plan such as a round of interviews. At one
              organisation, they were so worried about revealing their secrets
              it took a solid month of persuasion before they let me talk to any
              citizens. I gradually got the go-ahead by agreeing that a civil
              sercant would be present in every research session to introduce
              the session.
            </p>
            <h3>Ran an information gathering visit</h3>
            <p>
              While I worked for Social Security Scotland we arranged a visit to
              a DWP office in Belfast. About a dozen colleagues visited the
              office.
            </p>
            <p>
              I decided to run the visit as a research session to capture as
              many useful habits, attitudes and mental models as possible. I
              coached my colleagues in observing people doing their daily work,
              asking questions and taking notes. At the end of each day we did a
              quick sense-making meeting to compare what we've learned.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result we built up an extensive document describing how our
              new service would work in practice, based on observing social
              security advisers in their workplace.
            </p>
            <h3>Ran sensemaking workshops</h3>
            <p>
              In Scotland, I think the practice of sensemaking originated at
              Disclosure Scotland. I wasn't part of that team but I've used the
              sensemaking technique to check my research outputs are as
              objective as possible. It's a chance for colleagues to be part of
              the research rather than passively consuming the outputs.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the Scottish National Investment Bank I invited the observers
              back to run an affinity sort on the quotes from our research. I
              involved a service designer to map the quotes against their
              service blueprint. We also handed over content recommendations for
              the new bank's online service.
            </p>
            <h2>The outcome</h2>
            <p>
              Although pure research is challenging its one of the most
              rewarding parts of UX design. In the case of these organisations I
              gave them research outputs that shape their new service. That
              includes documented research themes with verbatim quotes, content
              recommendations (including a site map) and service blueprints.
