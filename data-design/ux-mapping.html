      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        UX Designers create wireframes and prototypes to describe new products
        and test these out on real people. Apart from designing screens, we also
        make maps of new services to get a top-down view of the whole product.
        In this article I'll describe techniques for mapping out a new product.
      </p>
      <p>I'd recommend that you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Make UX mapping a 'team sport': create maps with your whole team, using
          collaborative software
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep your maps simple: avoid unnecessary frills and focus on making the map
          brief and scannable
        </li>
        <li>
          At the end of a project or stage of work, make a permanent version of
          the map to keep your design and research alive
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In this article I'll use the terms <b>map, user flow, process</b> and
        <b>diagram</b> more or less interchangeably. A UX diagram can describe
        either:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A process that people go through in their daily lives - such as
          booking a flight or shopping for food; or
        </li>
        <li>
          A journey through a service, including a web service, website or app
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="team-sport">Mapping a process</h2>
      <p>
        At the start of a project you'll usually discuss what you're planning to
        research or build.
      </p>
      <p>
        The advantage of online boards like Miro, Mural and LucidChart is that
        you can map things out in real time.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're being asked to build a new online service, app or website,
        your team members will often know a lot about your users or customers.
        If there aren't any existing maps, you can use a board to quickly
        capture a process, based on the conversation you have.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an example of a process from the real world - organising a show
        for a local band:
      </p>
      <img
        src="images/organising-a-show.gif"
        alt="An animated GIF of a Miro board. A cursor adds boxes to a journey.."
      />
      <p>
        Miro lets you click on a post-it to add an arrow then a second post-it.
        Take it advantage of this to build your flow as quickly as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can engage with team members by mapping the board in real time.
        Alternatively, if you've spoken to someone and taken notes you can turn
        the notes into a map in your own time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The actual process of booking a show for a local band with limited time
        and money is a lot more convoluted than this. A map is just a version of
        reality that's easy to digest.
      </p>
      <h3>Pay attention to the words people use</h3>
      <p>
        Maps help capture the team's ideas as well as the language they use -
        for example, would your colleagues say 'book a show', 'run a show' or
        'organise a show'?
      </p>
      <p>
        You also need to use the real words of your users, based on your
        interviews. In some cases, the users will use different terms from the
        ones your team use. Research will help bring that out and help your team
        decide what terms to use in your websites and apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        This article is about User-Centred Design: my advice is start every
        project by talking to real users and customers.
      </p>
      <h3>Titles, arrows and text</h3>
      <img
        src="images/ux-flow-basic.PNG"
        alt="A simple but complete flow"
      />

      <p>
        I'll now move on to some of the details of making a 'user flow'. Start
        the map with a title like 'Organising a show for a local band'. You can
        add a tagline like 'From finding bands to moving equipment', if that's
        useful. Keep each post-it brief and to the point. Try to start each
        post-it with a verb, such as 'book', 'find', 'register' and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Connect each post-it with arrows. That will quickly tell people the
        information is flowing from left to right, which is the same as the
        'reading order' we use in the West. You want your diagram to be as
        'telegraphic' as possible - it should communicate instantly without
        making people think too hard.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don't need to polish the map to look perfect. The text in each box
        may be a different size, but that's fine for now. At the end of a
        project or a piece of work you can polish the map. I'll often re-create
        it in Figma or another design program.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there's a final stage like 'Play the show', you can give it a
        different colour or shape.
      </p>
      <h3>Add annotations</h3>
      <p>
        After you create the steps you can add annotations. For example, under
        each post-it you can add complaints, or 'pain points' you've found
        through research. This can be something annoying or time-consuming, such
        as calling a contact center and waiting for hours on the phone.
      </p>
      <img
        src="images/pain-points.PNG"
        alt="The UX flow with added pain points.'"
      />
      <h3>Decision points and alternative routes</h3>
      <p>
        If the flow depends on a decision or the answer to a question, add a
        square rotated 45 degrees. Add the question above the square. Label the
        routes which follow the question - such as 'yes or no'. Don't waste time
        trying to fit the question into your tilted square - it will look wonky
        and be hard to read.
      </p>
      <img
        src="images/decision-point.PNG"
        alt="A decision point in the map."
      />
      <p>
        Make the user flow about as tall as your laptop screen. That way, people
        can see everything by scrolling from left to right. Having to scroll
        vertically as well as horizontally creates extra effort. If the flow is
        really complicated and contains a lot of branches, consider splitting
        these up in a few diagrams, each with a different title.
      </p>
      <h3>Text-only versions</h3>
      <p>
        If any team members don't have access to the board or the software
        you're using, turn the flow into a set of numbered steps. I might break
        my diagram down into the following list:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Organising a show for a local band</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Check the dates with my bandmates</li>
        <li>Find a venue</li>
        <li>Find bands</li>
        <li>
          Question: Can we find enough bands for the date we've picked? - if no:
          postpone the show until we find bands
        </li>
        <li>Check what equipment we need</li>
        <li>Advertise the show</li>
        <li>Play the show</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Note I've used the first person 'we' in this example. Using the second
        person 'you' or the third person 'they/he/she' is also fine, as long as
        you're consistent.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find myself sharing this version of a user flow fairly often - for
        example, in an email or in a Slack conversation. On the internet, text
        works better than almost anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
        In UX design we often talk about 'accessibility'. We make designs which
        can be used by as many people as possible. You may work with people who
        are blind or have poor motor skills. On the other hand, someone might
        need to access the flow in a place with poor internet connectivity.
        Using a text version helps keep the diagram accessible.
      </p>
      <p>The complete user flow looks like this:</p>
      <img
        src="images/user-flow.PNG"
        alt="The complete user flow for 'Organising a show with a local band'."
      />
      <h3>Humanising the diagram</h3>
      <p>
        I like to add a human face representing the user, at the start of the
        flow. Overall, the diagram above has a rough, slightly cartoony feel.
        That fits my personal style: I like to encourage conversations.
        Deliverables which look rough and ready might encourage people to ask
        questions. Other designers will be more comfortable with a more polished
        look and feel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another thing to note: the larger the diagram gets, the smaller the text
        becomes when you share the diagram as a graphic. It can be annoying to
        open diagrams as email attachments and zoom in to read what's in every
        box. Again, for that reason, I'd recommend capturing a text-only version
        of the flow and sharing that version with people outside your team.
      </p>
      <h2>Mapping out a new online service, website or app</h2>
      <p>
        The second type of mapping involves creating a 'skeleton' of a new
        product - such as a website, online service or app.
      </p>
      <p>
        A very simplified flow of an online service might look like the
        following:
      </p>
      <img
        src="images/product-map.PNG"
        alt="A user flow for an online service, for local bands."
      />
      <p>
        One advantage of this type of map is that it's a great talking point at
        the start of a project. In the past, when we usually shared office
        spaces with colleagues we used to sketch screens by hand, often on a
        whiteboard. With remote working, collaborating with other people becomes
        more of a challenge. For me, coming up with a very rough, provisional
        flow of screens on a board is a good way to get people thinking and
        talking.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I run a workshop online I may share my screen and create the map
        while people talk. If people have ideas or questions I type these up on
        extra post-its and annotations. I add these next to the main flow. You
        can also run meetings where you challenge people to create their own map
        as part of a workshop, then compare different concepts of how the
        product will work.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can capture as much detail as you like - for example, under
        'Register' you might add a stage for the user having to get a code from
        an email in order to register with the service. You might also have two
        different journeys, one for an app and one an online service using a
        laptop or desktop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your conversations with your colleagues let you know how much detail to
        include, based on what's most important at the time.
      </p>
      <h3>Add icons</h3>
      <p>
        For a map of a new product, I often swap out the post-its for icons:
      </p>
      <img
        src="images/product-map-icons.PNG"
        alt="A map of a new product with icons for a website, an email confirmation and a login screen."
      />
      <p>
        Platforms like Miro offer basic icons. If you add icons, the map might
        be more aesthetically pleasing. It also communicates information more
        quickly. An icon with a label can be one of the fastest ways to
        communicate. Offer the label underneath the icon so that people can see
        the image first.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have good eyesight or you've zoomed in on the image, you'll
        notice one of the connecting arrows has a small kink in it. If you use
        boards rather than art packages to make maps, you'll often have
        imperfections like this. Use boards as a short-term solution and polish
        up your maps at the end of the project.
