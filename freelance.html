    Case studies
  </h2>
  <h3>
    2023-24 Interaction Design and User Research for ILF Scotland
  </h3>
  <p>
    We started by designing an online service for social workers to make 
    applications to ILF on behalf of citizens. We tested a prototype on social 
    workers then passed this over to developers to build the real service. We
    also ran an accessibility audit to identify any issues which might stop
    disabled people from using the service. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We're currently running interviews for ILF for a Discovery project.
  </p>
  <h3>
    2022-23 Content Design for Wilshire
  </h3>
  <p>
    We helped the international financial data company Wilshire launch their
    new Sharepoint intranet. We engaged with different company stakeholders to
    capture their requirements. We then designed a new look and feel based on 
    the company structure and an existing stock of photography.
  </p>
  <h3>
    2021-22 Interaction Design for Calba
  </h3>
  <p>
    Working with Calba, we designed a prototype version of a new online 
    application form for a small Scottish government body. We tested this on 
    users and made iterative improvements to the content and design. 
    We passed a version of the prototype to developers to build the real 
    online service. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We ran an accessibility audit to identify any issues which might stop 
    people from applying online. We then wrote JIRA tickets to the development 
    team to fix them.
